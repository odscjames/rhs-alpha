# OCDS Kingfisher

OCDS Kingfisher is a command-line tool for downloading, storing and analysing data from publishers of the Open Contracting Data Standard.  It requires python and a postgresql database.

See https://ocdskingfisher.readthedocs.io/en/master/ (or the docs folder in this code) for more - the shell scripts in requirements.rst followed by a command from cli-run.rst should be enough to download a complete dataset.
